## (1) What is the topic that you have finalized?

### The topic chosen is football players' rating, the website should allow user to search and select player they want, display the the player's overall rating as well as rating of categories including pace, sterngth, shooting etc. (if possible, allow user to compare between different players)



## (2) What are the data sources that you have curated so far?

### data is available from EA FC24 (the football game) online, I'm still trying to find a way to export or download all the data. (https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/ratings)
